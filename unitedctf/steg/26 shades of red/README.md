Your artist friends were sharing some color palettes, but something looks a bit off in the order. \
Can you crack the code and find the hidden messages your artist friends are sending? \

Note: The flag is all caps

# Writeup

This is another very easy challenge. \
First, simply realize that the first row is a legend wherein the first color represents an "A", the second color a "B", etc. \
Then by simply translating the second row according to the legend, the flag can be found. \
Of course, participants are encouraged to perform this challenge programatically to avoid tedious manual labour, but it is not a requirement.

flag: `FLAG-PIXELSAREMYPASSION`
