This audio file sounds a little weird. \
Can you put on your spectacles and try to find the hidden message?

# Writeup
This is quite a simple challenge that can be solved in 1 step if someone knows where to look. \
The name of the challenge is a subtle nod indicated that the audio program "Spek" should be used. \
After loading the wav file into spek, the flag is immediately given.
