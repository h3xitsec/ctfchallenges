Here is a glimpse of what people think of CTFLang:

```
@ESOFOU1234: 2. WORDS - PURE AG.ONY! NOT SURE WHY I'M M.AKING M.ORE #AGONY
```

```
@FRESHLEMON: I D.ON'T RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!! I SPENT MORE TIME CRYI.N.G. THAN PROGRAMMING #CRYING
```

```
@ALEXLAVOIE: I'M NOT A P.R.O. EVEN IF WR.OTE THE LA.NGUAGE #HELP
```

Hopefully, this won't discourage you. It does make for a good `flag` though!

Note: Flag is not in the standard `FLAG-...` format.
